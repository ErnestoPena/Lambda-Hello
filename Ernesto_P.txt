Hello everyone,

My name is Ernesto Pena, I am 41 years old and I live in Houston TX. My favorite hobby is chess but I just switched to programming. 
Being part of Lambda School will allow me to increase my earning potential as well as helping organizations to reach their goals. 


Alternate Reality.

I like to be surrounded by a lot of people and I am all about drinking and dancing all night long. LOL
